/*
 * DESCRIPTION: Makes a customer, who can buy and steal cakes or go to jail.
 * The Customer can donate to the PTSA
 * INPUT: Requires the name, weight, and wealth
 * OUTPUT: Either returns a customer, or that a customer can't do something because they are either in jail, or don't have enough money
 * EDGE CASE: A jailed customer is restricted in their activities. Customer randomly eats
 * one of two cakes if they are named the same. If the race of the customer
 * is not American, they are very limited in the activities they can do.
