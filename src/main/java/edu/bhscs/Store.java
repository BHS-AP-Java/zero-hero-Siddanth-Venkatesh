 * cakes have better quality the more the Store bakes.

 * OUTPUT: Will output information regarding whta the store
 * sells, how much inventory it has, and if something is bought improperly.

 * display two cakes as the same, even though it internally has two different cakes. You will only
 * be able to purchase one of the two cakes.
