/*
 * DESCRIPTION: Makes a PTSA that does a fundraiser to buy things for a school. All bakers are
 * automatically entered into a fundraiser. They lose a "cut" of their profits whenever someone buys from them for their fundraiser.
 * The PTSA will try to buy the cheapest things first.
 * INPUT: Requires the name of the school, the things he PTSA plans to buy, and how much those things cost,
 * as well as the cut the PTSA will take from every cake purchase from the baker.
 * OUTPUT: It will output all the things the PTSA is trying to buy, the amount of money they are trying to raise. It will also confirm
 * what stuff the PTSA can buy, assuming they buy the cheapest things up.
 * EDGE CASE: If the fundraiser tries to fundraise twice for the same thing, it will be counted twice.
 * If the fundraiser has equal value items, the PTSA will prioritize buying one randomly if they can only buy some of them.
 * The things the PTSA fundraises for should have articles attached to them, like "a computer", or "some new floors" or else
 * when it prints out those things, grammar errors will occur.
